A card has no styling initially, but one can be applied with `default`:
```
<aire-basic-card default></aire-basic-card>
```

To give it your primary background, use `primary`:
```
<aire-basic-card primary></aire-basic-card>
```

Same idea for `secondary`:
```
<aire-basic-card secondary></aire-basic-card>
```

To change the card's style when it is hovered, use `hover`:
```
<aire-basic-card hover></aire-basic-card>
```

There are three levels of padding for a card -- the regular amount, a small amount and a large amount:
```
<aire-basic-card padding></aire-basic-card>
<aire-basic-card padding-small></aire-basic-card>
<aire-basic-card padding-large></aire-basic-card>
```
