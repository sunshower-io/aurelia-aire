A card has no styling initially, but one can be applied with `default`:
```
aire-basic-card(default)
```

To give it your primary background, use `primary`:
```
aire-basic-card(primary)
```

Same idea for `secondary`:
```
aire-basic-card(secondary)
```

To change the card's style when it is hovered, use `hover`:
```
aire-basic-card(hover)
```

There are three levels of padding for a card -- the regular amount, a small amount and a large amount:
```
aire-basic-card(padding)
aire-basic-card(padding-small)
aire-basic-card(padding-large)
```
